* Java quiz: final keyword

A simple quiz:
Let's say we have this piece of code:
<code>public void method(Calendar cal) {
    final Calendar otherCal = cal;
    ..
}</code>

The <em>final</em> keyword affects whether or not the code is accepted by the compiler. Obviously. But does it affect the generated bytecode? What if I mangle the bytecode so that I include afterwards something like <code>otherCal = null;</code>

Will it trigger a runtime exception? Which one?
