* Java quiz on declaring exceptions as final

Which of the following statements hold for 'final' keywords in exception declarations for catch blocks?

<code>try {
} catch (<strong>final </strong>TypeAException ...
}
</code>

1) It's useless. The languaje allows it but it adds no value. The language also allows you to rewrite:
   <code>return Boolean.TRUE;</code>
with
<code>final Boolean result = Boolean.TRUE;
return result;</code>
2) Adds clutter discarded at runtime.
3) It treats the declared exceptions as final parameters, so they cannot be reassigned inside the block.
4) In Java 7+ it's used to avoid duplicated catch blocks.
5) In Java 7+ it's not allowed anymore.
