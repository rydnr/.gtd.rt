May I ask for better support for microblogging?

My 5-minutes research on this topic gives these results:
<ul>
  <li>Wordpress <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/microblogging">plugins</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-admin-microblog/">wp-admin-microblog</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mingle/">Mingle</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://status.net/download">StatusNet</a> (<a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> engine)</li>
</ul>

I appraise people posting long and detailed entries, and I feel I could be misusing the blog for microblogging. And maybe that could happen to some other people. At least, rcres, bmigu sends me interesting links via jabber regularly, which sometimes I repost here as 'mine' (whatever that means) ;).

So the question is: If we had a private microblogging engine/wp plugin, do you think it would be useful? Otherwise, another option could be sharing a Twitter account, but that means no difference but the lack of privacy...

Either case, I vote +1.
