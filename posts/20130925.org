* HTTP quiz: Virtual hosts under https
Hi,

Web servers usually allow defining different configurations based on the Host: header. That's called name-based virtual hosting.
Consider HTTPS traffic, in which the Host header is not known until the whole SSL negotiation finishes.

Which of the following sentences are correct?

<ol>
	<li>The web server has to offer a certificate with a given host name, before knowing which host name the client is requesting, so name-based virtual hosting cannot work for HTTPS hosts.</li>
	<li>The web server offers a default virtual host, and redirects when the Host header differs from the default.</li>
	<li>An update for SSL protocol is required for name-based virtual hosting over HTTPS.</li>
	<li>The easy option is to use IP-based virtual hosting for HTTPS hosts.</li>
</ol>
