* Google App Engine supports Java

I hope this is not old news for you, but last time I checked I thought Java wasn't supported.

Anyway, you can use <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google cloud-hosting services</a> for your prototypes, personal, and commercial <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/overview">Java-based</a> projects. You can experience how is using Google's BigTable in practice, even using <a href="http://www.jiql.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/">plain JDBC</a>.

For me, it's as easy to setup as Amazon's, but without forcing you to give your credit card or worry about how much you'll end up paying.

It could make sense to invest on a puppet-supported system infraestructure allowing you to easily deploy development or test environments using this (or similar) free hosting services.
