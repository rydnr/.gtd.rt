* Java 6 update 24

<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2011-304611.html">Sad news</a>.

The guy from <a href="http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm">securitynow</a> is advocating for the complete removal of Java (referring to JRE), stating that it's now worse than Adobe Flash or Adobe Reader in terms of vulnerabilities.

So far, I'm unable to retrieve details of any of the CVEs :(.
