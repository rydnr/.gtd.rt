* Port knocking

I came up with an interesting topic called 'port knocking' [1] and 'single packet authorization' [2]. It's a way to make firewalls conditionally stop dropping network packets whenever a concrete IP reaches certain ports in sequence during a limited time interval. There's even a physical port knocking lock!

Even though some people thinks of this as 'security through obscurity' [3], I think it has its uses. And SPA seems an obvious and nice extension to SSH.

I'm wondering if there's any real effort to spread the concept to areas like web servers or server-side Java, albeit it could be useful to strengthen the security to any architectural component, like databases.
