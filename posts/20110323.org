* Stop using mocks

Just forwarding a <a href="http://openmymind.net/2011/3/23/Stop-Using-Mocks">post</a> (which, btw, uses examples in .NET, but the idea remains).

I've never liked the so-called integration tests: those in which most of the time writing the test is spent dealing with the correct context data. And I'm not talking about Alinghi, but in general.

Which is the alternative? Don't use in-memory databases. Don't use databases. Just fake the behavior of external entities to behave as it the data was there already, but don't waste time building it.

In other words: if the test can be implemented with Mockito, then go for it. If for some reason it's not possible (for conceptual reasons, not framework limitations/bugs), then I'd think twice. And probably would reject wasting my time on it afterwards :).
