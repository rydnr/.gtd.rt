Your request resulted in an AccountProblem (403) error. Usually this
happens if you attempt to create a bucket without first having enabled
billing for the project you are using. Please ensure billing is
enabled for your project by following the instructions at `Google
Developers
Console<https://developers.google.com/console/help/billing>`. In the
project overview, ensure that the Project Number listed for your
project matches the project ID (k-test) from your boto config file. If
the above doesn't resolve your AccountProblem, please send mail to gs-
team@google.com requesting assistance, noting the exact command you
ran, the fact that you received a 403 AccountProblem error, and your
project ID. Please do not post your project ID on StackOverflow. Note:
It's possible to use Google Cloud Storage without enabling billing if
you're only listing or reading objects for which you're authorized, or
if you're uploading objects to a bucket billed to a project that has
billing enabled. But if you're attempting to create buckets or upload
objects to a bucket owned by your own project, you must first enable
billing for that project.
