* Introduction
** TODO A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:

code: @@beamer:some code@@
- the first, very @important@, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.


The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

* This is the first structural section
     
** Frame 1
*** Thanks to Eric Fraga 				      :B_block:BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_COL: 0.48
:BEAMER_ENV: block
:END:
for the first viable Beamer setup in Org
*** Thanks to everyone else 				      :B_block:BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_COL: 0.48
:BEAMER_ACT: <2->
:BEAMER_ENV: block
:END:
for contributing to the discussion
**** This will be formatted as a beamer note 			     :B_note:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: note
:END:
     ** Frame 2 (where we will not use columns)
     *** Request
         Please test this stuff!

# * A more complex slide
# ** A more complex slide
# This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
# with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
# *** Org mode increases productivity                               :B_theorem:
# :PROPERTIES:
# :BEAMER_env: theorem
# :END:
#     - org mode means not having to remember LaTeX commands.
#     - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
#     - Emacs!

#     \hfill \(\qed\)

** Two columns

*** A block                                           :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
:BEAMER_col: 0.4
:END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
    - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an
      @example@ block

*** A screenshot                                            :BMCOL:B_example:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.6
