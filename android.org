** Building
http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/building
*** Define resources
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources
Strings: strings, string arrays, plurals.
Typically stored in res/values-[country code]/*.xml
Accessed by other resources as @string/string_name
Accessed in Java as
R.string.string_name
*** Implement application classes
**** User Interface layout

Defined in XML files: res/layout/*.xml
Accessed in Java as: R.layout.layout_name
Accessed by other resources as: @layout/layout_name
The application can change the layout depending on the screen size or even the orientation: res/layout-land/main.xml

**** R.java
Generated at compile time from the resources.

**** onCreate() workflow
- Restore saved state:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
#+END_SRC java
If we don't call super.onCreate(), it will raise an error.
- set content view
#+BEGIN_SRC java
setContentView(R.layout.main);
#+END_SRC java
- initialize UI elements

#+BEGIN_SRC java
(EditText) findViewById(R.id.XX);
#+END_SRC java

- Link UI elements to code actions

#+BEGIN_SRC java
button.setOnClickListener(new Button.OnClickListener() {
    public void onClick(View v) { ... } };
#+END_SRC java

*** Package application

System packages application components and resources into a .apk file.
Developers specify required application information in a file classed AndroidManifest.xml

**** AndroidManifest.xml

- Application name
- Components
- Other: required permissions, application features, minimun API level
*** Install and run application
